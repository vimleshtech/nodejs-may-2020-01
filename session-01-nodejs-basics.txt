Variable Declaration or scope of variable:
	a =11		//global variable  (can be access from anywhere within .js)
	var d =556	//global variable, function level 		
	const m =667	//once assign , cannot be changed 
			const cannot re declare 
	let d  = 666	//block level accessiability {}
			let cannot re declare 

use strict:
	  force to declare the varible 
	   		
repl:
	read-eval-print-loop
		

Data type:
	Note : javascript is loosely type language

	a =11	//number
	a = true // boolean
	a="fkhffh" or a ='fhfj' //string
	a= [111,4,66,77,]   //object
	a ={id:11,name:'nitin'} //object
	
	There are following types of datatype
		number
		boolean
		string
		object
		function 
		

Object Operation:
	data =[111,44,66,777]	 //array
	data.length		//return count of element
	data.push(newval)	//add new value at last
	data.pop()		//remove last value
	data.shift()		//remove first value
	data.unshift(val)		//add new value at fist
	data.slice(start,end)		//return values from given index range
	data.splice(start,count)	//remove value from given range 

	forEach()
	sort()
	reverse()
	filter()
	
	spreader
